# Module18_Citi_Bike_Dashboard

## Navigate to https://bit.ly/3UmcQdj to view the Tableau Public Dashboard
## Data Cleaning Scripts are located in GitHub in Jupyter Notebook Folder - I primarily created one file - csw1nk_tableau_data for injestion into Tableau Public. I performed a few calculations in pandas, for example trip duration before loading.

## Map Write Up
### Western stations (closer to downtown) are launch points for lengthier rides, likely for leisure or long commutes, while central zones exhibit heavy bike-share traffic, hinting at bustling local activity and brief trips. The maps' color variations reveal neighborhood usage disparities, informing service and maintenance planning or promotional opportunities.

## Analysis
### This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of bike-sharing usage in the Citi Bike Program, highlighting key trends and user behaviors. Over 6.7 million rides cover a collective distance of 7.7 million miles, with consistent growth from January to April 2024. This growth is common as we enter into warmer months. Interestingly, electric bikes are gaining traction, especially among casual riders. 
### The Ride Utilization by Hour chart is particularly informative planning. It highlights that peak bike-sharing hours are at 8 AM and 5 PM, coinciding with standard commuting times. These peaks suggest the best times for city planners to schedule maintenance or station checks to minimize disruption, likely in mid-afternoon or late evening or even at the lowest time which is at 3AM.
### By examining the Start and End Stations detailed in the dashboard, we can strategically identify which stations are most frequented and thus, where to allocate resources effectively. For instance, stations with the longest trip durations are prime locations for stocking up on water stations, promotional brochures, bike repair kits, and setting up bathroom facilities. This targeted approach ensures that high-demand stations are well-equipped to enhance the user experience and meet the riders' needs efficiently.
